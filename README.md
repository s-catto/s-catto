Hi! My name is Sofia B. Candiotto, I'm a student at the Federal University of Paraná (UFPR), in Brazil 🇧🇷. 
</br>
I love maths and computer science! I'm still early in my graduation, but I aspire to be a teacher. 
</br> </br>
Fun facts:
- 💫 I've memorized the 💥Doomsday Algorithm💥 so I can tell the day of the week to any given date IRL, RT
(but, if anyone asks, it's witchcraft✨).
- 🦷 I have two extra teeth, yes counting the wisdom ones, that's 50% more wisdom, right there.
</br>
In conclusion, I'm an exeptionally wise wizard aiming to gather very fancy papers and spread ✨magic✨.
